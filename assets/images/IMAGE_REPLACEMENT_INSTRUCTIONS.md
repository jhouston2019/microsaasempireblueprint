# Image Replacement Instructions

## Background Image Update

The hero section background image has been updated to use a new AI-themed image.

### Required Action:
1. Replace the current `hero-background.jpg` with the new AI-themed image
2. Save the new image as `ai-empire-hero-bg.jpg` in this directory
3. The image should be optimized for web use (recommended: 1920x1080px or similar)

### Image Description:
The new background image features:
- Dark, futuristic digital artwork
- Glowing neon-blue human head profile outline
- Complex circuit-like neural pathways inside the head
- Central processing unit/CPU with warm yellow-orange glow
- Scattered digital numbers and data elements
- Perfect for AI/technology themed websites

### CSS Updates Made:
- Updated `index.html` hero section background URL
- Updated `assets/style.css` hero section background URL
- Changed gradient overlay to better complement the dark AI theme

The new image will create a perfect visual match for the "AI Empire Builder Blueprint" concept.
